Random-Motion Lawnmower Simulation
 - for simulating run times of a lawnmower 
   with random direction changes at a border
   
See comments for simulation assumptions.

   
Use cases:

1. At command line, call the function "t = RandomMower(width)" 
   Where width is the desired blade width of the lawnmower to simulate

2. Run "RandomMCTesting"
